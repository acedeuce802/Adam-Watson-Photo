  - Paragraph about myself
    -I grew up in Ann Arbor, MI and now reside in Southfield, MI.  I got my Mechanical Engineering degree from Kettering University.  My first passion was automotive, and going to races and car meets is what initially sparked my interest in photography.  I found it interesting to combine the technical aspect of cameras with the artsy side, and capturing action shots is always my favorite.  As I begun to ride bikes, my passion started to shift.  I've raced in more events than I can count, mountain bike, gravel races, and road races.  Eventually I started bringing my camera to races and taking pictures after I'd finish, and now documenting the races is just as important to me as racing in them.
